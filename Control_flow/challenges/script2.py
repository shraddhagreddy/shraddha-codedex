Instructions
U.S. high schools typically last for four years, from freshman year to senior year. 🚌💨

First, ask the user to enter their grade as an integer.

Create a four-year high school grade system using an if/elif/else statement:

grade is 9, print 'Freshman'
grade is 10, print 'Sophomore'
grade is 11, print 'Junior'
grade is 12, print 'Senior'
Everything else is 'TBD'

"""

elif grade==11:
  print('Junior')
elif grade==12:
  print('Senior')
