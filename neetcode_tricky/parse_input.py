Parse Input
Sometimes we have to do more than just convert the input to a single type. We might need to restructure the input in some way. This is called parsing the input.

Suppose you read a list of integers separated by commas into a string, but you want to store them as a list. You can use the split() method to split the string by commas. This will convert "1,2,3" into a list of strings ["1", "2", "3"].

number_string = "1,2,3"

string_list = number_string.split(",")

print(string_list) # Output: ['1', '2', '3']
The above code will split the numbers by the "," substring, and store each number as a string in the list string_list, which is a list of strings. In this case, the "," is considered the delimiter.

Challenge
Implement the read_integers() -> List[int] function. It should read a line from stdin, without printing anything, and return a list of integers. You may assume every line will be in the following format, where the numbers are separated by commas:

1,2,3,4,5
