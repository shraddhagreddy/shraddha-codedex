Dict Practice
One of the most common uses of a dictionary is to count the occurences of elements in a list. For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], we can count the quantity of each element in the list using a dictionary.

The result would be a dictionary like this:

count = {
    1: 3,
    2: 3,
    3: 3
}
Challenge
Implement the function count_characters(word: str) -> Dict[str, int]. It should take a string word and return a dictionary with the count of each character in the word. The keys should be the characters and the values should be the count of each character.

Hint: If you access a key that doesn't exist in a dictionary, it will raise a KeyError. Make sure to handle this case by checking if the key exists before trying to access it.
