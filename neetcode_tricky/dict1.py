Dict Remove
You can remove an item from a dictionary using the pop() function. This function takes a key as an argument and removes the key-value pair from the dictionary. If the key doesn't exist, it will raise a KeyError.

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

my_dict.pop("a")

print(my_dict) # Output: {"b": 2, "c": 3}

my_dict.pop("d") # Raises KeyError
If you don't want to worry about handling the KeyError, you can use the second argument of the pop() function. This argument is the default value that will be returned if the key doesn't exist.

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

value = my_dict.pop("d", 0) # Returns 0, no error occurs
You can also use the del keyword to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary. This is a bit more concise than using the pop() function.

my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

del my_dict["a"]
Challenge
Implement the remove_keys(my_dict: Dict[str, int], keys: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int] function. It accepts a dictionary my_dict and a list of strings keys. The function should remove all the keys in the list from the dictionary and return the modified dictionary. If a key doesn't exist in the dictionary, ignore it.

Be careful: If you try to remove a key that doesn't exist, it will raise a KeyError. Make sure to handle this case by checking if the key exists before trying to remove it, or using the second argument of the pop() function.
