# Write code below ðŸ’–
"""# range()
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use a for loop and the range() function.

The range() function returns a sequence of numbers. By default, the sequence starts at 0 and increments by 1, ending at a specified number.

for i in range(6):
  print(i)

For number i inside range(6), which is 0 through 5, print number i.

This will output:

0
1
2
3
4
5

Notice how this stops at 5, and 6 is not printed. This is because range() actually ends one before the specified number.

Instructions
detention

Suppose you got detention and the teacher wants you to write "I will not use Snapchat in class" on the whiteboard 100 times.

Create a detention.py program that does this using code.

(This is where we begin to see the true power of computing. What takes humans hours can take a computer microseconds. ðŸ¤¯)
